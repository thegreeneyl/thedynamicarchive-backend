Drupal module. Visit https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further
information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

  1. Enable the Double field module at Administration > Extend.
  2. When creating a new field on a content type or custom entity type, choose
     "Double field" from the drop-down menu.
  3. On the Field Settings form for the Double field, define the two subfields
     as you would with any other field.
  4. Optionally, on the "Edit" form for the Double field, you may choose
     options for whether or not the subfields are "required" or limit allowed
     values from the collapsible fieldsets "First subfield" and
     "Second subfield" at the bottom of the page.
  5. Additional display options for the double field will be found under
     "Format settings" (gear icon) in the "Manage display" form.
